# output variable 
# this python print()
#  function is often used to output varaibel in python

# example

# in the print() function, you ouput muliline varaible ,separedt by a comma
x="python "
y="is"
z="awsome"

print(x,y,z)

# you can also use the + operators to output multii variable  

x="python "
y= "is "
z="awasome"

print(x+y+z)

" Notice the spece characte afte python and is without them the resule would pythois awasome"


# example 
x=5 
y=10 
print(x+y)
# In the print() function when you try to combain a string and number with the + operators , python will give erro 
# example
x=5 
y="john"
# print(x+y)

#  the best way to ouput multivaraible in the print() function is to separate the varaible with 
# commas, which support diffrent data types

x=7 
y= 'john'
print(x,y)
