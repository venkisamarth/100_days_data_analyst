# Built in data types

# in programming data types is and important 
# concept
# varaible can store data of diffrent types and diffrent types can do diffrent  thisgs
 
# pytoh has the following data types  built in data types by default in these categoreies

# text type: str
# numaric type: int float ,complex
# sequnce types: list tuple ,range
# maping type : dict
# set type:  set, forzenset

# bollean type: bool 

# binary types : bytes,bytearrry, memoryview
# none type: nonetype


# getting the data type 

# you can get the data type of any object by using the type() function

# example 
# print the data type of the varaible x:

x=5 
print(type(x))


# setting the data type
# In python the data types is set when you assign a value to a varible 

x="Hello world" # str

y=20 # int 
z=20.3#float

a=1j# coplex

my_list=["aple","java","python ","sql","mongo db"]# list 

my_tuple=("apple ","banana","cherry")

r_=range(6)# range

my_dict={"name":"venki","age":36}

my_set={"apple","annana","cherry"}

x=True

x=b"Hello"# this is the non

x=bytearray(5)
x=memoryview(bytes(5))

x=None # none type
