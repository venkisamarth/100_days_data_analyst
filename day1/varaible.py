# varaibles are containers for storing the data  
# creating varaibles  
# python had no command for declaring a varaible 
# a varaible is created the mommnet you first assign a valie to it

# example  
x=5
y="venki"
print(x)
print(y)


# variable do not need to be decalre with any particulr type , adn caneven change type after  they have been set 


# example
x=4 #  x is the type of int 
x="Sally" # x is now of type str

print(x)

# Casting  
# if you want to specify the data type of a variable this can  be done with casting  

# Example 
x=str(3) # x will be "3"
y=int(3)# y will  be 3
z=float(3) #z will be 3.0

print(x)
print(y)
print(z)
# single or double quotes?

# strings variable can be declared eiter by using single or double quotes
x="johan"
# is the same as 
y='john'
print(x)
print(y)

# case-sensitive
#example this create two varaible:

a="A"
A="Salt"
print(a)
print(A)
