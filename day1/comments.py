# python comments 

# commentscan ve used to explain pytho code 
# comments can be used to make the code more readable 
# comments can be used to prevent execution when testing code 

# creating a comment
# comments starts with a # , and python will ignore them 

# This is the single line commemnt 
print("hello world!")


# comments can be ppace at the  end of a line  and python will ignore the rest of the that line 

print("hellow rold, world") # this is the end line  comment

# a comment does not have to be text that explaines the code, it can also  be used to prevnt pytho from executing code 

# example  
print("Hello world!")
print("cheers, Mate!")



# Multiline comments
# python does not really have a syntas for multiline comments 

# to add a multiline comments you could a # for each line 

# example  
# This is a comment 
 # written in 
#  morethat just one license

print("Hello , world")

# Or, not quite as intended, you can use a multiline string.

# Since Python will ignore string literals that are not assigned to a variable, you can add a multiline string (triple quotes) in your code, and place your comment inside it:
# python can ingore the string litrals that or not assigned to the varaible 

# this are 

" this  is the one of the "
"muliline comment "
